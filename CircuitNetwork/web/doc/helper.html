FUNCTIONS
    activated(inp_dic, ope, spe)
        Check if there is an activation signal for a operon.
        :param inp_dic: dictionary of operon and their activation requirement.
        :param ope: operon whose activation signal is checked.
        :param spe: species that may induce activation signal for the operon.
        :return: True only if species match any of the activation requirement of an operon, False otherwise.
    
    contain_all_elements(list_of_lists, lst)
        Check if a list that matches the specified list.
        :param list_of_lists: list whose inner lists are checked.
        :param lst: list matched
        :return: True only if the list_of_lists contain a list that matches lst.
    
    contain_an_element(lst1, lst2)
        Check if at least on of the elements is a list is in another list.
        :param lst1: list that may contain at least one element from anther list.
        :param lst2: list whose elements are searched for in another list.
        :return: True only if at least an element from lst2 in found in lst1.
    
    format_values(value_list)
        Create a list by adding elements of a list in a standard expression.
        :param value_list: list whose elements with non-standard expression are reformatted and added to the new list.
        :return: a new list with elements in standard expression.
    
    get_matching_list_and_index(list_of_lists, lst)
        Get a matching list within a list of lists that matches a specified list.
        :param list_of_lists: list whose inner lists are checked to see if any of them match the specified list.
        :param lst: list checked.
        :return: list within list_of_lists that matches the specified list.
    
    list_is_type(lst, typ)
        Check if all elements of a list are the specified type.
        :param lst: list whose elements are checked.
        :param typ: type specified.
        :return: True only if all elements of the list is the specified type, False otherwise.
    
    match_any_list(list_of_lists, lst)
        Check if a list matches any of the lists within a list of lists.
        :param list_of_lists: list of lists that contain potential matching lists.
        :param lst: list matched.
        :return: True only is at least a list within the list of lists matches the specified list.
    
    promoter_activation(inp_dic, rep_dic, ope, spe, memory_spe, indirect_flag)
        Check if a promoter is activated.
        :param inp_dic: dictionary of operon and their activation requirement.
        :param rep_dic: dictionary of operon and their repression requirement.
        :param ope: operon whose activation is checked.
        :param spe: species that can activate or repress an operon.
        :param memory_spe: species that can activate or repress an operon.
        :param indirect_flag: Boolean flag for checking indirect activation of an operon
        :return: True if the operon is activated.
    
    remove_duplicated_lists_within_a_list_of_lists(list_of_lists)
        Create a list that contains unique lists within another list.
        :param list_of_lists: list that contains duplicated lists.
        :return: list that contains unique lists from the list.
    
    remove_duplicates_within_list(lst)
        Create a list with only unique elements form another list.
        :param lst: list whose unique elements will be stored in a new list.
        :return: a list that contains non-duplicated elements from the parameter list.
    
    remove_parentheses(sequence)
        Remove the outermost parentheses of a string, and return the element right after the closing parentheses.
        :param sequence:
        :return:
    
    repressed(rep_dic, ope, spe)
        Check if there is an repression signal for a operon.
        :param rep_dic: dictionary of operon and their repression requirement.
        :param ope: operon whose repression signal is checked.
        :param spe: species that may induce repression signal for the operon.
        :return: True only if species match any of the repression requirement of an operon, False otherwise.
    
    reverse_index(sequence, element)
        Find the last occurring index of an element in a sequence.
        :param sequence: list checked.
        :param element: element searched.
        :return: index of the last occurring index of an element.
    
    split_by(sequence, element)
        Split a sequence by the first occurring index of a specified element, and return the the resulting two-halves of
        the sequence in a dictionary.
        :param sequence: sequence that is split.
        :param element: element whose first occurring index splits the sequence.
        :return: dictionary that contains the split two halves of the sequence.
