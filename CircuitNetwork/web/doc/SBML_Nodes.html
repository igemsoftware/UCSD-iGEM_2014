CLASSES
    Nodes
    QualitativeSpecies
    Transitions
    
    class Nodes
     |  Place, passive component of Petri Net model, and transition, active component 
     |  of Petri Net model, file constructor.When instantiated, a qualitative species 
     |  list and a transitions list are created. Data is then stored according to 
     |  SBML standards.
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __init__(self)
     |      Instantiate qualitative species and transitions list objects
     |  
     |  writeQualSpecies(self, filename)
     |      @Parameters: filename
     |          type: string 
     |          description: desired file name for a particular qualitative species
     |          SBML text file(i.e. operon or chemical species)
     |      @Method:
     |          Write SBML text file for a qualitative species stored in the qualitative 
     |          species list object. File is then stored in the current working directory.
     |  
     |  writeTransition(self, filename)
     |      @Parameters: filename
     |          type: string 
     |          description: desired file name for a particular transition SBML text 
     |          file(i.e. input transition or output transition)
     |      @Method:
     |          Write SBML text file for a transition stored in the transition list 
     |          object. File is then stored in the current working directory.
    
    class QualitativeSpecies
     |  Qualitative species, such as operons and chemical species, constructor
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __init__(self, id, compartment, name='NONE', maxLevel='1', constant='false', miriam_id='NONE')
     |      @Parameters:
     |          id: node id 
     |          compartment: node compartment, for example, operons belong in the plasmid compartment
     |          name: node name, default=NONE because operons don't have a name 
     |          maxLevel: node threshold, default = 1 because a logic model was implemented 
     |          constant: denotes node passivity, if constant = True then the node does not interact with 
     |          network. Thus, the node does not transfer information.
     |          miriam_id: Minimal Information Required in the Annotation of Models id. This allows for 
     |          a standarized citation of literature references 
     |      
     |      @Method:
     |          Translate all the inputed information to SBML and append to list
     |  
     |  appendToQualSpecies(self, node_name)
    
    class Transitions
     |  Input and output transition constructor; transitions denote the operon's input 
     |  and output reaction in our network.
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  input_transition(self, node_name, trans_id, input_id_boolean_tuple, operon_id, trans_logic)
     |      @Parameters:
     |          node_name: name of node object, instantiated using the Node class 
     |          trans_id: transition id 
     |          input_id_boolean_tuple: tuple of the form (input chemical species, repressor boolean)
     |              input chemical species: chemical species involved in reaction 
     |              repressor boolean: denotes whether a chemical species is a repressor (True or False)
     |              Can input a list if multiple operators are involved, such is the case for an AND gate 
     |          operon_id: operon id 
     |          trans_logic: transition logic denotes the Boolean logic of a reaction ('AND', 'OR', 'NOT')
     |          
     |      @Method:
     |          Translate all the inputed information to SBML and append to list
     |  
     |  output_transition(self, node_name, trans_id, output_id, operon_id)
     |      @Parameters:
     |          node_name: name of node object, instantiated using the Node class 
     |          trans_id: transition id 
     |          output_id: single variable input which denotes the id of an operon's output
     |          operon_id: operon id 
     |          
     |      @Method:
     |          Translate all the inputed information to SBML and append to list
