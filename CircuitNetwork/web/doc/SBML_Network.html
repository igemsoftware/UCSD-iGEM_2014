FILE
    /Users/jenhantao/Documents/UCSD_IGEM/CircuitNetwork/web/SBML_Network.py

DESCRIPTION
    //Description: 
        Each class generates a corresponding SBML description of the input information 
        and appends the information to a list which is then written to file

    Transitions
    
    class CloseModel
     |  Require class, need to append closing SBML statements for network model
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __init__(self, model_name)
     |      @Parameter:
     |          model_name: model object, instantiated using Model class
    
    class IntermediateStep
     |  Require class, need to append necessary SBML statements for network model
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __init__(self, model_name)
     |      @Parameter:
     |          model_name: model object, instantiated using Model class
    
    class Model
     |  Creates a model object. When instantiated the class appends all the URLs 
     |  necessary to understand our network model
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __init__(self, id='SBider_Network')
     |  
     |  writeSBML(self, filename)
     |      @Parameters: 
     |          filename: desired file name for network file 
     |          type: string 
     |      
     |      @Method:
     |          Write SBML formatted network model text file. File is then stored in 
     |          the current working directory.
    
    class QualitativeSpecies
     |  Qualitative species, such as operons and chemical species, constructor
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __init__(self, id, compartment, name='NONE', maxLevel='1', constant='false', miriam_id='NONE')
     |      @Parameters:
     |          id: node id 
     |          compartment: node compartment, for example, operons belong in the plasmid compartment
     |          name: node name, default=NONE because operons don't have a name 
     |          maxLevel: node threshold, default = 1 because a logic model was implemented 
     |          constant: denotes node passivity, if constant = True then the node does not interact with 
     |          network. Thus, the node does not transfer information.
     |          miriam_id: Minimal Information Required in the Annotation of Models id. This allows for 
     |          a standarized citation of literature references 
     |      
     |      @Method:
     |          Translate all the inputed information to SBML and append to list
     |  
     |  appendToQualSpecies(self, model_name)
    
    class Transitions
     |  Input and output transition constructor; transitions denote the operon's input 
     |  and output reaction in our network.
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  input_transition(self, model_name, trans_id, input_id_boolean_tuple, operon_id, trans_logic)
     |      @Parameters:
     |          node_name: name of node object, instantiated using the Node class 
     |          trans_id: transition id 
     |          input_id_boolean_tuple: tuple of the form (input chemical species, repressor boolean)
     |              input chemical species: chemical species involved in reaction 
     |              repressor boolean: denotes whether a chemical species is a repressor (True or False)
     |              Can input a list if multiple operators are involved, such is the case for an AND gate 
     |          operon_id: operon id 
     |          trans_logic: transition logic denotes the Boolean logic of a reaction ('AND', 'OR', 'NOT')
     |          
     |      @Method:
     |          Translate all the inputed information to SBML and append to list
     |  
     |  output_transition(self, model_name, trans_id, output_id, operon_id)
     |      @Parameters:
     |          node_name: name of node object, instantiated using the Node class 
     |          trans_id: transition id 
     |          output_id: single variable input which denotes the id of an operon's output
     |          operon_id: operon id 
     |          
     |      @Method:
     |          Translate all the inputed information to SBML and append to list
